# Dynamic-Gantt-Chart-Creation-in-Google-Sheets
Gantt charts are essential tools for project management, allowing teams to visualize project timelines and track progress. In this guide, we will walk through the process of creating a dynamic Gantt chart in Google Sheets, incorporating features such as a timeline, task progress tracking, and conditional formatting.

Step 1: Setting Up Basic Information
To begin, we need to set up the basic information required for our Gantt chart:

Project Start Date: This is the date when the project begins.
Task List: Each task should have a start date, duration in days, and an end date. It is common to group tasks under phases or categories. For this example, we will create tasks under Phase 1.
Adding Tasks
Enter the tasks for Phase 1.
Specify the start date and the duration for each task.
Calculate the end date by adding the duration to the start date and subtracting one day.
Ensure that subsequent tasks start one day after the previous task ends.
Step 2: Creating the Timeline
Next, we will create the date range or timeline for the chart area:

Start with a date, such as June 1st, and drag it across six more cells to create a week.
Use a custom number format to display only the days of the month.
Below the date, display the first letter of the day of the week using the TEXT function combined with the LEFT function.
Merge the cells to display the full date of the first day of the week.
Dynamic Timeline
To make the timeline dynamic:

Link the first cell of the chart area to the project start date.
Use a formula to add one day to each subsequent date and drag it to the right. This allows the timeline to update automatically when the project start date changes.
Step 3: Formatting the Chart
Proper formatting enhances the readability of the Gantt chart:

Select the entire worksheet and center the vertical alignment.
Adjust column widths for better visibility.
Turn off gridlines for a cleaner look.
Format the header rows to stand out, using a smaller font size and a dark background.
Step 4: Adding Conditional Formatting
To visually represent task progress, we will use conditional formatting:

Select the cells in the chart area.
Go to Format > Conditional Formatting and select Custom Formula.
Create a formula that checks if the date in the timeline falls between the start and end dates of each task.
Set the color of the bars to match your design preferences.
Step 5: Enhancing the Gantt Chart
To further improve the Gantt chart:

Adjust the timeline to always start on a Monday by modifying the formula to account for the week date of the project start.
Add a feature to scroll through the chart by entering a display week input.
Highlight the current day in the timeline using conditional formatting.
Step 6: Adding Task Assignment and Progress Tracking
To track who is assigned to each task and their progress:

Insert new columns for task assignment and progress percentage.
Use the SPARKLINE function to create visual bars representing the progress.
Handle errors in the progress column using the IFERROR function to ensure blank cells do not disrupt the chart.
Step 7: Final Touches
To complete the Gantt chart:

Calculate the duration of each phase using the MIN and MAX functions to find the earliest start date and latest end date.
Group tasks for easier viewing and printing by selecting the rows and using the Data > Group Rows option.
Conclusion
By following these steps, you can create a dynamic Gantt chart in Google Sheets that not only helps in managing tasks but also enhances your project management skills. This chart will allow you to visualize timelines, track progress, and manage resources effectively.
